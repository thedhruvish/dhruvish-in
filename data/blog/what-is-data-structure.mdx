## Why It is Important

> if you store 5ml water than does not use any hue container. in similler programming if you store any small (non floating values) number than use int does use loog or float datatype. if you use loog or float data type than vest of memorys.

> any items or data store in the many different type to store.

## what is algorithem

> Algorithem is like a recipe a **step-by-step** set of instructions to create or solve somethings.

- Algorithem are the which type of data store how and fast to access also less time

- Algorithem are defines how data should be store,accessed, and processed efficiently with main goal of minimizing time or space.
