## What ?

- A module it a just file just contain code.(function,class,variable)
- In You are all the code only one file that handle it very complex that why we use module.
- In js we have 2 types of module
  - CommonJS (default module)
  - ES6 (change in package.json **type:module**)

## How ?

> I have one file that write a function to calculat sum of two numbers.

- this is _sum.js_ file

```js
const sum = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

export { sum }; //   named export import {sum} from './sum.js';    // both name must be same

export default sum; // default export import sumFun from './sum.js';   // you can use any name you wnat
```

- This is my _main.js_ file

```js
import { sum } from "./sum.js";

console.log(sum(2, 3));
```

## Why ?

- This makes you code organzied, reusable and maintainable.
- This makes your code easy to read and understand.
- This makes your code easy to test and debug.

## Conclusion

- Modules are you code dividend into small pieces( files). that helps you to reuse code.
