## Kernel

- The cors component of the OS.
- Manages the low level tasks like hardware, memory management and cpu scheduling.
- bridge between hardware and os.
- without os can't run os
- When start of computer that first load kernel.
- This is kernel responsibilites:
  - Process Management
  - Memory management
  - File System Management
  - System Calls Handling.

| Type                  | Description                                                                  | Example           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Monolithic Kernel** | All OS services run in a single large block in kernel space.                 | Linux, Unix       |
| **Microkernel**       | Only essential services run in kernel space. Others run in user space.       | Minix, QNX        |
| **Hybrid Kernel**     | Mixes both monolithic and microkernel designs.                               | Windows NT, macOS |
| **Nano Kernel**       | Only provides hardware abstraction, relying on higher layers for management. | Some real-time OS |
| **Exo Kernel**        | Exposes hardware to applications for maximum control.                        | Research OS       |

## OS

- os is a GUI interface .
- It provied user-friendly environment.
- Responsibilites:
  - User Interface
  - Program exceution
  - Resource Management
  - Networking
